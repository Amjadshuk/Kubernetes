# Kubernetes Repo Example

Welcome to the Kubernetes Repo Example! This repository provides you with an easy way to deploy and manage applications using Kubernetes. With just a few simple steps, you can set up and remove deployments using the provided shell scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: You need access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy applications.

2. **kubectl**: Make sure you have the `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Docker**: You'll need Docker installed to build and run containerized applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Amjadshuk/Kubernetes.git
    cd kubernetes-repo-example
    ```

2. **Deploy an Application**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.
   - Run the `init.sh` script to deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster.
   
     ```
     ./init.sh
     ```

   This script sets up the application deployment, service, and any necessary resources in your cluster.

3. **Removing the Deployment**:
   - If you want to remove the deployment from your cluster, you can run the `remove.sh` script.
   
     ```
     ./remove.sh
     ```

   This script will clean up the resources associated with the deployment.

## Repository Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- **init.sh**: The script to deploy the application.
- **remove.sh**: The script to remove the deployment.
- **kubernetes/**: Directory containing Kubernetes manifest files.
- **images/**: Directory containing images used in this README.
